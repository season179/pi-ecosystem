# @season179/pi-moa

Adds a synthetic `moa` provider to Pi for Mixture of Agents orchestration.

The package is named `pi-moa` to match the pi-ecosystem package naming convention. The runtime provider remains `moa`, so models are selected with `moa/<preset>`.

## Usage

```bash
pi install ./packages/pi-moa
pi --model moa/default
```

## Configuration

MoA reads config from the first file found:

1. `<cwd>/.pi/moa.json`
2. `~/.pi/agent/moa.json` or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/moa.json`
3. built-in defaults

Each enabled preset appears as a synthetic model, for example `moa/default`.

### Tuning reference latency

Reference outputs are truncated to `maxReferenceOutputChars` before they reach the
aggregator or the display, so any generation past that budget is discarded. The
aggregator cannot start until the slowest reference finishes, so `referenceMaxTokens`
caps each reference's generation to keep verbose references off the critical path.
It only ever lowers a caller-supplied limit; presets that omit it run uncapped. The
built-in `default` preset sets it to `1024` (well above the ~500 tokens kept), so the
kept text is unchanged while runaway references stop early.
